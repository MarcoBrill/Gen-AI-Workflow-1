# Generative AI Workflow for Image and Video Enhancement

This repository contains a Python script for building, training, and testing a novel Generative AI workflow that ingests images or videos and generates a professional version of them. The workflow uses state-of-the-art algorithms like **Stable Diffusion** for image generation and **DAIN** for video enhancement.

## Features
- **Image Enhancement**: Transforms low-quality images into professional-grade images using Stable Diffusion.
- **Video Enhancement**: Enhances video quality using DAIN (Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-ai-workflow.git
   cd generative-ai-workflow
